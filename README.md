# Music Genre Audio Classification
1st ML Project,

here, I learned how to train a neural network using tensorflow and keras, to classify audio samples obtained from MARSYAS's genre collection dataset.

obtained dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?resource=download

### Training 3 types of neural networks on the classified data:
1. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
2. Convoluted Neural Network (CNN)
3. Reoccurent Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) Network

### See [jupyter_notebooks](https://github.com/abbie-bola/music_genre_classification/tree/main/jupyter_notebooks) for the results shown when the codes are run
    + my interpretations of the plotted graphs.
    + features I implemented/explored on my own, in addition to what was taught in the tutorial.
